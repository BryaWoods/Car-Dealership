# üèÅ Car Dealership App üèÅ

## Description of the Project

The Car Dealership Management App is a Java console application designed to streamline vehicle management within a car dealership setting. It caters to dealership staff and managers, providing essential functionalities to add, remove, display vehicles, and save inventory data.


## User Stories

- As a user, I want to find vehicles within a specific year range to offer customers newer or older model options based on their needs.

- As a user, I want to search for vehicles based on their make and model to provide customers with options that match their preferences.

- As a user, I want to search for vehicles based on their color to help customers find vehicles that suit their style preferences.

- As a user, I want to be able to find vehicles within a specified price range so that I can assist customers with their budget requirements effectively.

- As a user, I want to find vehicles within a certain mileage range to offer customers options that align with their desired mileage.

- As a user, I want to search for vehicles based on their type (car, truck, SUV, van) to provide customers with options that suit their intended use of the vehicle.

- As a user, I want to list all vehicles in the dealership's inventory to have an overview of available options for customers.

- As a user, I want to add a new vehicle to the dealership's inventory so that it becomes available for sale.

- As a user, I want to remove a vehicle from the dealership's inventory when it is sold or no longer available for sale.

- As a user, I want changes to the dealership's inventory (adding or removing vehicles) to update the file to ensure data consistency and accuracy.
